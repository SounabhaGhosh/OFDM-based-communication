Promote Intelligent Communication Systems
By simulating adaptive modulation, the project demonstrates how systems can make smart, dynamic decisions (like choosing between QPSK or 64QAM) to optimize throughput and reliability based on environmental conditions like SNR.

Bridge Theory and Real-World Wireless Systems
This simulation helps translate complex concepts from textbooks (like fading channels, modulation, BER) into practical, visual results â€” aiding students, engineers, and researchers in better understanding how adaptive systems behave in real-life 5G networks.

Enable Future-Ready Network Design
With 5G and beyond requiring massive connectivity, low latency, and high data rates, adaptive modulation is a core enabler. This project provides a foundation for developing and testing link adaptation strategies crucial to next-gen networks.
